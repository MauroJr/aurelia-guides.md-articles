The purpose of the **Aurelia-Guides** project is to collect and organize all Aurelia related information **that is not included** in the [Aurelia official documentation](http://aurelia.io/docs.html).Since this is a dynamic definition, the following few paragraphs try to refine it, with the goal to collect as valuable information as possible, with the least amount of redundancy, overlaps with official documentation and maximum accessibility. This last attribute _maximum accessibility_ is the area where we expect to offer some **innovation**.

There is a very important difference between the official Aurelia documentation and Aurelia-Guides repository: while Aurelia documentation is a very smartly crafted by a computer program which extract the documents from the actual code files, Aurelia-Guides is designed and created by humans - a very specific class of humans that consider themselves to be Aurelia Application Developers and is specifically crafted to appeal to that same class of humans. In the general case it is expected that Aurelia Application Developers will use the official Aurelia documentation as a reference and use Aurelia-Guides as inspiration. So these two repositories are really two sides of the same coins and it is anticipated that the information will flow from one side to the other, bidirectionally.

This document - **Guide on Aurelia-Guides** addresses two different  categories of subscribers, each interacting with two categories of content. Each of these two categories has specific workflow assigned, which describes the process of contributing data from that category. The four links below, will get you to the relevant pages with details of the creating or consuming that content.

### A Readers category 
- **[Tutorials / Blogs](blog.aurelia-guides.com/Readers-Guide#read_blogs)**: Guides on how to find the articles of interest using Aurelia-Guides advanced search interface

- **[Code Snippets](blog.aurelia-guides.com/Readers-Guide#use_snippets)**: Information about types of code snippets and use case based search for the snippet you need.

### B Writers category

- **[Tutorials / Blogs](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/writers-Guide#auth_blogs)**: Creating information in this format is the primary method for adding value to Aurelia-Guides repository and includes everything of interest on how to build an Aurelia application or Aurelia Plugin, using different development tools, different back-ends, various databases, interfacing third party API, etc..(_This definition is expected to be expanded as we develop this project_). 

- **[Code Snippets](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/writers-Guide#auth_snippets)**: Collecting the code snippets idea came as a consequence of the realization that **[Aurelia/Discuss](https://gitter.im/Aurelia/Discuss)** chat room can be an interesting source of information formatted in the Q&A fashion which we named a code snippet for a lack of better term. There is an ongoing effort that will result with the better integration between our **[Snippet Manager tool](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/2015/08/19/snippet-manager/)** and Gitter based chat rooms using the **[Gitter API](https://gitter.im)**, that would allow us to search and extract discussion threads and post the results for later consuming in Aurelia-Guides repository - most likely used as the inspiration for fully expanded tutorial about the subject discussed in that captured thread.
