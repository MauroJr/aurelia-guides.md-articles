## Introduction
Since the beginning of Aurelia days the **[Aurelia Skeleton Navigation application](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation)** is used as a start of almost any Aurelia project. At the same time there were many "newbie" questions in **[Aurelia Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/Aurelia/Discuss)** about the details of this application's structure. 

So, Aurelia-Guides presents an alternative Aurelia Application Skeleton structure, which is documented in details in this article. You can also get the code **[here](https://github.com/aurelia-guides/AG_Aurelia_Application_Skeleton)**

----------
## Basic structure of the Aurelia-Guides full stack skeleton

Let's build the following structure to be used in all subsequent samples, by adding some additional components as needed.

Unlike the [Aurelia Skeleton Navigation application](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation) which is mostly focused on development and testing of the Aurelia component of the full stack application, we are starting with the whole thing from the very beginning

Let's create the "outer container"  first - using **AG_Aurelia_Application_Skeleton** as the project name. In this whole tutorial we will use ME**A**N environment, where **A** stands for Aurelia of course.

#### Tools we will use

- [Sublime 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) text editor
-  [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) console
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#brand=CHMB&utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sk&utm_medium=ha) browser
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) in all cases that require the server side debugging

**Note** See [Aurelia Development Environment and Tools](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/2015/08/22/aurelia-development-environment-and-tools/#comment-33) and [What you need to know before writing your first Aurelia application](http://blog.aurelia-guides.com/2015/08/17/what-you-need-to-know-before-writing-your-first-aurelia-application/) for a lot more information
